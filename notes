In future you want to replace tasks1.py by db_func.py
To create an example of database run example.py

interface2 is now interface

for now 4 files in project: main.py, nutes, db_func.py, example.py, interface.py
and one file to keep data: data.db

To do:
- save current table, and tasks table when quiting +
- load right lay out for curent tab at the start   +

- clear button saves all data and load empty curent tab +
- make not posible to change parent of a task +
- show the remaining time when hovering over progress bar +
- warning before removing task from db +
- show sum of remaining tasks in curent (sum of planned tasks) + 
    - negative time ramaining possible +
- checkbox make the sesion done (in individual progres bars and in total (see update func in interface)) +
- pre defined tasks list
    - cant add Python (first row) to the lists +
    - remove info about family members + 
    - think how to deal with task that are no longer in db (can there be diffrent task with the same id now?)
    - refresh list table after removing one (or creating)
- make posible to add untrack time (maybe in diffrent way)
- edit from database tab (dropdown manu?)

-------
compile to exe file and use

Future plans:
- show checkpoints, ability to cross them and show next
- improve visuals
- daily/weekly etc raports
- filters 
- tree view of the database (see pysimplegui.Tree)
- progras bar when in Edit/notes view
- ability to create new databases
- sounds effects??
